# Logitech-G29-G27-G25-USB-Pedal-Adapter

Thanks to Marcin648 for helping with coding this thing

This adapter will convert the 8-bit logitech pedals into 10-bit pedals, without changing the pots.
Tested on G29, should also work for G27/G25.

Use pinout from this video: https://youtu.be/k5CtXG1rpZg

It has two modes:
- clutch and accelerator axis connected (for use in flight sims)
- all axis disconnected from each other (for use in racing sims)

To change the mode you need to press clutch and accelerator pedals at least 3/4 way for 10 seconds.

Calibrating in windows can be difficult due to the two modes, i recommend tweaking it with DXTweak2.
